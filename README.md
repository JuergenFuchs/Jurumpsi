Sometimes war is killing
Sometimes it's saving lives
It's the judgement of faith
It's nothing that men can dictate
Corporal Leslie Allen carried them from Tambu
Saved his brothers in arms
Went out and followed through
There and back again
Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again
Bullets all around
Out of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay
As he carried them away
Sometimes war is killing
Sometimes it's saving lives
From Australia shore
Bull Allen went to war
Sometimes war is saving
Sometimes it's taking lives
Thanks to one single man
A dozen more survives
There and back again
Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again
Bullets all around
Out of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay
As he carried them away
Some men return from a war in a bag
And yet the world knows the story
Others return unwilling to brag,
Alive and humble at heart
Nooooo
There and back again
Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again
Bullets all around
Out of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay
As he carried them away

Standing here, I realize you were
Just like me trying to make history.
But who's to judge the right from wrong.
When our guard is down I think we'll both agree.
That violence breeds violence.
But in the end it has to be this way.
I've curved my own path, you've followed your wrath;
But maybe we're both the same.
The world has turned, and so many have burned.
But nobody is to blame.
It's tearing across this barren wasted land.
I feel new life could be born beneath
The blood stained sand.
